Hi David
 
1) On each customer we need a button saying "View Status Detail" or something
like that.
 
2) Then we need a new page which lists the nine stages as per the attached
document.
 
3) If you click on one of these it expands to show all the subsections shown in
the documents.
 
4) The ones which say they need a tick box have a tick box, 
 
5) The ones which have YES against Upload Template to Solariffic have a link to
the uploaded 'Template' document available for download.
 
These templates should be accessed from the 'document database'.
master file'
 
6) The ones which have YES against Upload completed document to Solariffic have
the ability to upload the completed document against the customer.
 
I have finished up to Stage 7, still working on Stages 8 / 9
